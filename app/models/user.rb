#user- all people that utilize the platform.

#librarian- the employees that work to fix bugs and monitor the platform for any inappropriate activity, handle any reported material. They are also in charge of scheduling meetings for the users of the platform to meet up and chat, similar to an online "book club meeting".

#admin- the big bosses, hire the "librarians".
